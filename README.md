# Predictive-analysis-of-GRACE-satellite-data

This is the combines Deep Learning for fusing GRACE Satellite data and reseach done on the 
following paper.

Research paper: "Combining physically based modeling and Deep Learning for fusing GRACE 
satellite data: Can we learn from mismatch?"

Data used:
GRACE->
    Gravity recovery and climate experiment (GRACE) enabled remote sensing of TWS anomalies, 
    i.e., variations from a long-term mean, at regional to continental scales. This study uses 
    the monthly mascon TWSA product released by Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL). 
    
NOAH->
    (Available from 2000-2019)
    The NOAH LSM from NASA's global land data assimilation system maintains surface energy and water 
    balances and simulate the exchange of water and energy fluxes at a soil-atmosphere interface. 
    The NOAH simulated TWS is calculated by summing soil moisture in all four soil layers (0-200 cm
    depth), accumulative snow water, and total canopy water storage.
