# Predictive-analysis-of-GRACE-satellite-data
"""
• Extraction of GRACE Satellite data (available from 2003 to 2017) and land surface model data(available from 2000 to
2019).
• Train CNN deep learning models by using of training data to learn the mismatch between TWSA
simulated by a land surface model and that observed by GRACE.
• Testing and validating the results by observing correlation coefficient, Nash-Sutcliff efficient and RMSE.
• The obtained CNN model may be used to predict the observed TWSA without requiring GRACE TWSA as inputs.
